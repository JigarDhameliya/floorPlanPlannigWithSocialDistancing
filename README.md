# floorPlanPlannigWithSocialDistancing
You will write a program that attempts to create a dynamic floor plan that allows parties of people to be seated as they come to the restaurant. If the party cannot be seated safely while maintaining social distancing, then the party is denied seating at that time in the restaurant, otherwise tables are configured to allow the party to be seated safely
